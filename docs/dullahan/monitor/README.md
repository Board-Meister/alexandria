# Intro

Monitor Bundle is a internal tool for recording critical errors to help with debugging. It automatically saves
the last error into `var/last_error_trace` file and comes with system wide error persister for 500's or critical.
Thanks to this you have a way automatic way for recording all unexpected errors without any setup. It comes with
integration of the [User Bundle](/docs/dullahan/user/README.md), so it is obvious what user generated that error.
