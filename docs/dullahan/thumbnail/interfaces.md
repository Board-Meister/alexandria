# Manage interfaces

For programmatic use of the Thumbnail Bundle we have set few interfaces:
- ThumbnailGeneratorInterface
- ThumbnailServiceInterface
- ThumbnailUrlResolverInterface

With those interfaces you can generate a thumbnail based ont he configuration, manage existing thumbnails and generate
url to them.
